# Urogenital Schistosomiasis Research Project

## Project Overview

This README document provides an overview of the research project on predicting Urogenital Schistosomiasis in rural areas. The project aims to analyze various factors that might influence the presence of Urogenital Schistosomiasis among individuals and to develop predictive models for this health condition.

## Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are as follows:

1. To identify and explore factors that might influence the presence of Urogenital Schistosomiasis in rural Kenya.
2. To develop predictive models that can accurately predict the likelihood of Urogenital Schistosomiasis based on various predictor variables.
3. To provide insights that can contribute to understanding the epidemiology and risk factors associated with Urogenital Schistosomiasis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this research project contains information about individuals in rural Kenya, including demographic information, school-related factors, water-related behaviours, and health data. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

## Methods

The research project follows the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and missing values. Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, and relevant preprocessing steps are performed.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering:** Potential predictor variables are identified, and new features are created if needed. These variables are then used for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and summary statistics are generated to explore the distribution of variables, correlations, and potential relationships between predictor variables and the outcome variable.

4. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical tests such as t-tests and ANOVA are conducted to determine the significance of relationships between predictor variables and Urogenital Schistosomiasis presence.

5. **Model Development:** Predictive models, including Negative Binomial Regression, is developed using selected predictor variables to predict Urogenital Schistosomiasis presence.

6. **Interpretation and Conclusion:** The results are interpreted, and conclusions are drawn based on the findings from the data analysis.

## Predictor Variables

The following predictor variables are considered in the analysis:

- Age
- Gender
- Socioeconomic Status
- Water Collection Pattern
- Group Name

## Data Analysis

The dataset is analyzed using exploratory data analysis techniques and statistical modelling. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are created to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships. Statistical tests determine the significance of relationships between predictor variables and Urogenital Schistosomiasis presence.

## Results

The analysis results will be presented through visualizations, statistical summaries, and model performance metrics. The significance of predictor variables and their relationships with Urogenital Schistosomiasis presence will be discussed.

## Conclusion

The research project aims to contribute to the understanding of Urogenital Schistosomiasis risk factors in rural Kenya. The insights gained from this study can help in developing targeted interventions and strategies to prevent and manage this health condition.
